This project performs customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm on a mall customer dataset. The aim is to group customers into distinct clusters based on their age, gender, annual income, and spending score. These insights help businesses understand different customer types and develop targeted marketing strategies.

The workflow includes:

Data preprocessing and scaling

Finding the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method

Applying K-Means clustering

Visualizing the clusters in 2D using PCA

Analyzing cluster-wise behavior for business insights
